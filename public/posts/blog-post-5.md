Multi-Food Mode (Premium Feature)
---------------------------------

You can now easily track all of the whole foods and drinks in an image using Nutrify's upgraded AI model.

Simply take a photo of food and Nutrify will break down what it can see to the ingredient level, estimating weights and number of servings.

Best practice is to make sure the foods/drinks you'd like to track are in the field of view.

If Nutrify makes a mistake, you can easily edit these items in the pop up.

Multi-Food Mode breaks down a plate of food into individual ingredients with estimated weights and nutrition information.

Single-Food Mode remains for free instant on-device one image, one food tracking.

552 New Foods

We've over doubled the size of the Nutridex (from 518 → 1070, +552 foods, a 107% increase)!

Each food comes with a beautifully designed custom icon.

And with the new Multi-Food Mode, these should be quite fun to collect!
